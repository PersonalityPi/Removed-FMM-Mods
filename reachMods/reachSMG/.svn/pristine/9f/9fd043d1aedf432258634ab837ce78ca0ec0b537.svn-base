Halo Reach SMG local cosmetic mod for Halo Online Eldewrito ms23 build.
Made by 343i or Saber 3D commands made by dany5639 using Shockfire's TagTool and Camden's commands.

Unzip into your game's main folder. It should look like:
Halo Online\mods\tagMods\reachMods\reachSMG\reachSMG.fm

Use FMM (FoundationMM by Clef) to install the mod.

Use that .bat to install the mod in case there's an issue with FMM.

It should be compatible with any mods.

The zip contains tagtool and my tool, source on https://github.com/dany5639/HOTTCC . 
TTCC or HOTTCC reads the last tag of your game and converts the commands using that.
