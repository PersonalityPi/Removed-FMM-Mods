This file contains the fixed command file already but here are the instructions if you already have the DMR installed, this is also the reddit post incase it ever gets lost or removed:

Reach DMR working in 0.6

NOTE: This requires you to already have Dany's Reach DMR mod downlaoded in your tagmods file. DON'T ASK FOR IT

1) Download the fix (updated .cmdX file): https://ufile.io/tf1u4

2) Replace "Halo Online\mods\tagmods\reachMods\reachWeap\reachDMR\commands\reachDMR.cmdX" with downloaded file

3) Reinstall mod using FMM

Update: Please re-download and apply the fix! There was a small animation issue where it would play the full reload animation even when the mag was not empty. This has been fixed. (Thank you Nax | ナキシェさん for noticing this behavior). The download link has been updated along with the VirusTotal scan link.
